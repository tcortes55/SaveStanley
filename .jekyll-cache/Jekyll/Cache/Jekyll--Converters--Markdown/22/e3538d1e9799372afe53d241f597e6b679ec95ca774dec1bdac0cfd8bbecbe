I"<p>I’m a huge fan of NBC’s sitcom “The Office”. I first watched it a few years ago, and I remember the first time I saw episode “Booze Cruise” as if it had been yesterday. I literally had to pause the episode so I could get myself together, stop laughing and start paying attention again. I’ve watched the entire series, and now I’m rewatching it following <a href="https://officeladies.com/">Office Ladies</a>, a podcast by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey in which they discuss a new episode of The Office each week.</p>
