I"â<p>Iâ€™m a huge fan of NBCâ€™s sitcom â€œThe Officeâ€. I first watched it a few years ago, and I remember the first time I saw episode â€œBooze Cruiseâ€ as if it had been yesterday. I literally had to pause the episode so I could get myself together, stop laughing and start paying attention again. Iâ€™ve watched the entire series, and now Iâ€™m rewatching it following <a href="https://officeladies.com/">Office Ladies</a>, a podcast by Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey in which they discuss a new episode of The Office each week.</p>
