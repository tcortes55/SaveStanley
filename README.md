# Stanley's Day At The Office

This is my first experience with game development. I created an endless runner game inspired on TV show **The Office**. In the game, the main character is **Stanley Hudson** (portrayed on TV by Leslie David Baker), and the goal is to avoid colliding with his co-workers in order to get to the end of the work day.

I attended a 1-week online course provided by [Alura Cursos Online](https://github.com/alura-cursos) on game development, during which I implemented most part of this game. We used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for the animation, but each developer implemented the mechanics for their own game.

I used **[Jekyll Now]**(https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for creating a [blog](https://www.savestanley.com/) where I discuss my (so far short) journey in game development, as well as the episodes from _The Office_ which have brought me inspirations for the game. Jekyll Now is very easy to use, you can set up your blog in minutes.

Currently, I am still developing new features for the game in my spare time, so keep checking it out for new stuff!
